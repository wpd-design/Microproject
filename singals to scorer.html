<p><b><center>Signals to scorers<center></b></p>
<p>It is important that the scorers note down the play accurately and therefore the appropriate
 signals will be made by the umpire when the ball is dead (see Law 2.13). In addition to the
 following, the umpire repeats signals of dead ball, wide, and no-ball to the scorers. Scorers
 are required to acknowledge the signals from umpires; and umpires are required to get an 
acknowledgement before allowing the match to proceed.</p>

<p><b>FOUR</b></p>
<p>If a batsman scores four when they hit the ball across the boundary (not by actually running
 them), the umpire signals this by waving their arm back and forth in front of the chest. This
 signal varies a lot between umpires, from two short, restrained, waves finishing with the 
arm across the chest, to elaborate signals that resemble those of a conductor of an orchestra.
Whichever way the umpire signals a four they must, by law, finish with their arm across 
the chest (so as to avoid confusion about whether a No Ball was delivered as well).</p>

<p><b>SIX</b></p>
<p>A six scored by hitting the ball over the boundary is signalled by the umpire raising both
 hands above their head.For a six to be scored, the ball must come off the bat, so it is
 impossible to have six byes for a ball crossing the boundary (without there being overthrows)
.</p>

<p><b>BYE</b></p>
<p>If runs are to be scored as byes, the umpire will hold up one open palm above the head.</p>

<p><b>Leg bye</b></p>
<p>Leg byes are signalled by the umpire touching a raised knee.</p>

<p><b>Short run</b></p>
<p>If one of the batsmen turns to complete runs after the first without grounding their person
 or equipment behind the popping crease, then a short run is signalled by the umpire tapping
 their near shoulder with their fingers and the short runs are not scored. If more than one 
run is short, the umpire will inform the scorers as to the number of runs scored.There is also
 a case of deliberate short running, where the umpire will disallow all runs, although this 
is a rather rare occurrence.</p>
