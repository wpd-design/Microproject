<p><b><center>DECISIONS AND SIGNALS</center></b></p>
<p>During play, the umpire at the bowler's end makes the decisions, which they mainly indicate
using arm signals. Some decisions must be instantaneous, whereas for others they may pause
 to think or discuss it with the square leg umpire, especially if the latter may have had a 
better view.</p>
<p><b>At the end of an over</b></p>
<p>The umpire keeps a record of the deliveries and announces the completion of an over. 
Occasionally an umpire may miscount, leading to one too many or too few balls being bowled 
in the over, however in most grades the scorers may communicate with the umpires to 
determine the correct count.</p>
<p><b>When the ball is in play</b></p>
<p>These decisions have an important effect on the play and are signalled straight away.</p>
<p><b>OUT</b></p>
<p>An umpire will not give a batsman out unless an appeal is made by the fielding side, 
though a batsman may walk if they know themself to be out. This is nowadays rare, 
especially in Tests and first-class matches for contentious decisions; however, it is the 
norm for a batsman to walk when they are bowled or obviously caught. If the fielding side 
believes a batsman is out, the fielding side must appeal, by asking the umpire to provide a 
ruling.</p>
<p>The umpire's response is either to raise their index finger above their head to indicate 
that the batsman is out, or to clearly say "not out", which is usually accompanied with a 
shake of the head.The 'out' signal is the only signal that, if indicated by the 
striker's end umpire, does not require confirmation by the bowler's end umpire.<p>
<p><b>No-ball</b></p>
<p>Either umpire may call, and signal, no-ball, for an illegal delivery, although each umpire
 has unique jurisdictions. The most usual causes for no-balls are foot faults or a ball 
passing above a batsman's waist without bouncing, each of these being under the jurisdiction
 of the umpire at the bowler's end. The square-leg umpire will rarely have to call a no-ball,
 as their jurisdiction is limited to infringements that occur less frequently such as short 
pitched deliveries which pass the batting crease above the batsman's shoulders. The signal is
 to hold one arm out horizontally and shout "no-ball"; the idea being that the batsman is 
aware of the no-ball being bowled.[6] In matches under the auspices of the ICC, it may also 
be a no-ball if the umpire feels that the bowler's arm is bent more than 15 degrees 
(throwing rather than bowling). The ICC have chosen to amend Law 21.2 (Fair Delivery â€“ the 
arm) as a result of controversy concerning the legality or otherwise of bowling actions of 
certain prominent bowlers.</p>
<p><b>FREE HIT</b></p>
<p>n certain forms of limited overs cricket, such as T20s and ODIs, a no-ball that is the 
result of the bowler overstepping the crease or bowling above a batsman's waist will be 
penalised by the next delivery being a free hit. The umpire will signal this by circling a 
finger horizontally over their head, usually following a no-ball signal (and any other signal
s associated with the no-ball such as a boundary). During a free hit delivery, batsmen cannot
be dismissed caught, bowled, leg before wicket or stumped.</p>
<p><b>WIDE</b></p>
<p>A wide is an illegal delivery, due to it being "wide of the striker where they 
are standing and would also have passed wide of them standing in a normal guard 
position" (Law 22). A wide is signalled by extending both arms out horizontally and 
is accompanied by a call of Wide Ball. If a delivery satisfies the criteria for both
 a No Ball and a Wide, the call and penalty of No Ball takes precedence. Umpires are
 not to signal a wide until the ball has passed the batsman. If a batsman chooses to
 pursue a wide delivery, once contact with the bat takes place it cannot be called 
wide.</p>
<p><b>Dead ball</b></p>
<p>If the ball is no longer considered in play it is a dead ball. An umpire will signal this
 by crossing and uncrossing their wrists below their waist with the call Dead Ball, if they 
are required to do so under certain Laws, and also may do it if they think it is necessary 
to inform the players.</p>
<p>A similar signal is also used to indicate a "not out" from the Decision Review System. 
This is signalled by an umpire crossing their hands in a horizontal position in front and 
above their waist three times.</p>
